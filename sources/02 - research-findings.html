    <h1>Research Findings</h1>

    <h2 class="highlight">Participant Profiles:</h2>
    <p>The 24 research participants were between the ages of 18-45.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Survey Participants (20):</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Young Adults (18-25): 8 participants</li>
            <li>Mid-age Users (26-35): 9 participants</li>
            <li>Older Users (36-45): 3 participants</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Interview Participants (4):</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Age Range: 19-25 years</li>
            <li>Gender Distribution: 2 male, 2 female</li>
            <li>Fields of Study: Business, Media Arts, UI/UX, Video Production</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="highlight">Identified Needs:</h2>
    <p><strong>Data Efficiency:</strong></p>
    <p class="indented">Participants noted that an audio-only mode would save data, particularly for users with poor internet access or data limits. It would also allow for faster load times and prevent buffering interruptions.</p>

    <p><strong>Multitasking:</strong></p>
    <p class="indented">Participants expressed that an audio-only mode would enable them to listen to content while commuting, exercising, or performing other tasks. For example, it would allow users to listen to podcasts or music without impacting internet speed when gaming.</p>

    <p><strong>Awareness of Third-Party Services:</strong></p>
    <p class="indented">40% of participants were aware of third-party services for audio-only playback but found them unreliable. This highlights the need for a built-in feature within YouTube.</p>

    <h2 class="highlight">Identified Pain Points/Challenges:</h2>
    <p><strong>Internet Speed:</strong></p>
    <p class="indented">Users with slower internet speeds reported frequent buffering issues while using YouTube, with 40% of participants experiencing interruptions.</p>

    <p><strong>Battery Drain:</strong></p>
    <p class="indented">Watching videos consumes significant battery life, especially for users primarily interested in audio content. An audio-only mode could reduce battery usage, extending usability during long activities like commuting or studying.</p>

    <p><strong>Unnecessary Video Content:</strong></p>
    <p class="indented">Many creators produce content primarily for audio (e.g., podcasts, music), making video streaming redundant and resource-intensive for users only interested in the audio.</p>

    <h2 class="highlight">Key Themes:</h2>
    <p><strong>Strong Interest in an Audio-Only Feature:</strong></p>
    <p class="indented">Over half of the participants expressed strong interest in an audio-only feature. 8 participants selected "Definitely," while another 8 selected "Maybe" or "Neutral."</p>

    <p><strong>Data and Battery Efficiency:</strong></p>
    <p class="indented">Participants highlighted the benefits of reduced data usage, fewer interruptions, and longer battery life with an audio-only setting.</p>

    <p><strong>Multitasking:</strong></p>
    <p class="indented">Participants noted that an audio-only feature would allow them to perform other tasks while using YouTube, such as commuting or gaming, without interruptions from slow internet speeds.</p>
