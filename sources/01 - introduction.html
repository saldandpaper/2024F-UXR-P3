    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
        The purpose of this research was to evaluate the user demand for an audio-only feature in the YouTube mobile app. Having an audio-only feature would address user needs such as saving data, enabling multitasking, and improving app accessibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        The research study was conducted over a nine-day period with 24 participants aged between 18 to 45. The participants were recruited through Discord, social media, and direct communication. Twenty participants completed a 10-question survey. This survey included questions about the users' frequency on YouTube, internet speeds, and interest in YouTube implementing an audio-only feature. The four remaining participants were interviewed in person to gather more detailed findings. The interviews asked participants about their YouTube usage habits, situations in which they used YouTube only for audio, and how beneficial an audio-only feature would be for them.

        This research study combines survey findings and in-depth interviews to determine if there is sufficient user interest to justify implementing an audio-only feature in YouTube.
