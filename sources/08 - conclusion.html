    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Overall, the research concluded that among students, the interest in an audio-only mode on YouTube is high, and there is a segment of customers that YouTube is losing to third-party services.</p>

    <p>By adding this feature, YouTube can increase user retention and potentially attract new customers. Additionally, it will improve data usage for users, which, in turn, can increase their engagement time with the platform. Features like playlists and shortcuts could also enhance the experience for users who utilize YouTube while multitasking.</p>

    <p>Addressing the loss of customers to third-party applications should be a top priority. Since audio files already exist on YouTube, integrating this feature into the UI could prevent customer migration to other applications. This would not only address existing user issues but also attract new customers. This approach offers significant impact with minimal effort.</p>

    <p>While features such as audio-only controls, playlists, and shortcuts are more "nice-to-have" than essential, they can make the platform more appealing to audio-focused users and enable YouTube to compete with platforms like SoundCloud and Spotify.</p>

    <p>By implementing these recommendations, YouTube can expand its customer base and create a better experience for its existing users.</p>
