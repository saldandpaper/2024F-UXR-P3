    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>

    <h2 class="highlight">Data Collection Methods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Surveys:</strong> Shared on platforms like Discord, Facebook, Instagram, and personal networks. A total of 20 participants completed the survey, providing quantitative data and qualitative insights through open-ended questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> Conducted with three participants to gather detailed feedback on YouTube habits, challenges with video playback, and opinions on an audio-only feature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="highlight">Data Analysis Techniques</h2>
    <h3>Quantitative Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frequency Distribution:</strong> Analyzed survey responses to identify patterns in YouTube usage and playback challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Used pie charts and bar graphs to represent trends like daily usage and interest in audio-only features.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Tabulation:</strong> Compared demographic data (e.g., age) with responses to understand perceptions of the audio-only feature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Qualitative Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Thematic Analysis:</strong> Reviewed open-ended responses and interview transcripts to identify recurring themes such as data-saving needs and multitasking preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Keyword Frequency:</strong> Highlighted terms like "data," "audio," and "playback" to prioritize user needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Synthesis of Insights:</strong> Combined findings from both analyses to create a comprehensive picture of user needs and challenges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="highlight">Key Findings</h2>
    <h3>Quantitative Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>YouTube Usage Frequency:</strong> 45% use YouTube daily, 20% several times a week.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest in Audio-Only Feature:</strong> 40% would "definitely" use it, 20% are "maybe" interested.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet Speed Issues:</strong> 40% experience buffering, while 30% report excellent connectivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Awareness of Third-Party Tools:</strong> 40% are aware of audio-only tools, though many find them unreliable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Qualitative Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pain Points:</strong> High data usage and battery drain during video playback were common frustrations.</li>
        <li><strong>User Scenarios:</strong> Participants frequently cited multitasking needs (e.g., commuting, working) as reasons for preferring audio-only options.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Positive feedback included comments like "An audio-only mode would be a game-changer." Some participants preferred video and expressed less interest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="highlight">Actionable Insights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduce an audio-only toggle to address data consumption and battery life concerns.</li>
        <li>Prioritize features that enhance multitasking capabilities, such as seamless playback during other activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="highlight">Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sample size of 20 participants may limit generalizability.</li>
        <li>Participants were primarily tech-savvy, potentially skewing results toward users familiar with YouTube alternatives.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By combining quantitative trends with qualitative feedback, the research highlights a clear demand for an audio-only feature, addressing critical user needs and enhancing the overall experience.</p>
