    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>The study was conducted on very short notice and within a limited period. As a result, the participant diversity is fairly limited. Additionally, the questions were created in a rush, leading to some questions sounding very similar.</p>
    <p>The places we contacted were heavily frequented by YouTube users, but the forum posts often got lost in massive chat logs. For interviews, more preparation time was needed to gather detailed information. This resulted in the loss of 2 out of 6 potential interview participants.</p>

    <h2>Future Considerations</h2>
    <p>Breaking down the limitations reveals three key issues: question language and flow, preparation time, and distribution channels.</p>

    <h3>Question Language and Flow</h3>
    <p>The questions should be run and tested at least twice to ensure they flow logically and are easily understood by participants.</p>

    <h3>Preparation Time</h3>
    <p>Due to the short notice, question quality and participant diversity were compromised. There was insufficient time to identify and reach out to interview participants or survey respondents. To address this, more time should be allocated for preparation in future studies.</p>

    <h3>Distribution Channels</h3>
    <p>The survey distribution was limited to random chats, where it often got buried in a sea of unrelated messages. While this method yielded some responses, a better approach would involve distributing surveys in targeted announcement channels or communities more receptive to research participation.</p>
